# Transparent Charity Donation Platform

A blockchain-based solution bringing unprecedented transparency, accountability, and efficiency to charitable giving.

## Overview

The Transparent Charity Donation Platform transforms philanthropic giving by creating an end-to-end traceable system for donations. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures that every contribution can be followed from donor to beneficiary, with complete visibility into how funds are allocated, spent, and what impact they create. This system rebuilds trust in charitable organizations, eliminates inefficiencies, and maximizes the impact of each donation.

## Core Components

### Donation Management Contract

Handles the receipt and allocation of charitable contributions:
- Securely processes donations in multiple cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies
- Creates immutable records of each donation with timestamps and donor information
- Enables donors to specify allocation preferences for their contributions
- Supports recurring donations and conditional giving
- Implements tax receipt generation and donation history tracking
- Manages donor privacy preferences while maintaining transparency
- Enables donor communication and updates on funded projects
- Supports donation matching programs and corporate giving initiatives

### Project Milestone Contract

Defines and tracks the progress of charitable initiatives:
- Establishes clear, measurable objectives for each charitable project
- Creates verifiable milestones with specific completion criteria
- Implements milestone verification processes using multiple validators
- Releases funding tranches upon milestone completion
- Provides real-time progress updates to stakeholders
- Manages timeline extensions and project modifications
- Creates accountability for project implementation teams
- Supports complex multi-phase charitable initiatives

### Expense Tracking Contract

Provides complete financial transparency for charitable operations:
- Records all expenditures with detailed categorization
- Links expenses directly to specific projects and milestones
- Verifies expenses through multi-signature approval processes
- Stores supporting documentation for each transaction
- Implements budget management and variance tracking
- Calculates program-to-overhead ratios automatically
- Flags unusual spending patterns for review
- Provides complete audit trails for regulatory compliance
- Enables comparison of projected versus actual expenses

### Impact Measurement Contract

Quantifies and communicates the real-world results of charitable work:
- Defines standardized metrics for measuring social and environmental impact
- Collects and verifies impact data from multiple sources
- Calculates key performance indicators for each project
- Compares results against predefined targets and benchmarks
- Generates comprehensive impact reports for stakeholders
- Enables cross-project and cross-organization impact comparison
- Supports both quantitative and qualitative impact assessment
- Implements verification mechanisms for reported outcomes
- Calculates return-on-donation metrics for donors

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on a blockchain infrastructure that ensures:
- Immutable record-keeping of all financial transactions
- Cryptographic verification of claimed achievements
- Decentralized validation of expenses and impact
- Integration with traditional financial systems
- Scalability to handle organizations of any size
- Cross-border functionality for global charitable work
- Data privacy with selective transparency options
- Interoperability with existing charity management systems

   cd transparent-charity
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install

   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Making a Donation
```javascript
// Example code for donors
const donationAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0"); // 1 ETH
await donationManagementContract.donate(
  projectId,
  allocationPreferences, // optional
  message, // optional
  { value: donationAmount }
);
```

### Creating a Project Milestone
```javascript
// Example code for charitable organizations
const milestoneDetails = {
  title: "Distribute 1,000 water filters",
  description: "Purchase and distribute water filters to 1,000 households in target region",
  fundingRequired: ethers.utils.parseEther("5.0"),
  estimatedCompletion: 1682515200, // Unix timestamp
  verificationCriteria: "GPS-tagged photos of distributions, signed receipts from beneficiaries",
  validators: ["0xabc...", "0xdef..."]
};

const milestoneId = await projectMilestoneContract.createMilestone(
  projectId,
  milestoneDetails
);
```

### Recording an Expense
```javascript
// Example code for financial tracking
const expenseDetails = {
  amount: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.5"),
  category: "supplies",
  description: "Purchase of 100 water filtration units",
  recipient: "0x123...", // vendor address
  receiptIPFSHash: "QmZ...", // documentation
  projectId: "0x789...",
  milestoneId: "0x456..."
};

await expenseTrackingContract.recordExpense(expenseDetails);
```

### Reporting Impact
```javascript
// Example code for impact reporting
const impactData = {
  beneficiariesReached: 450,
  waterQualityImprovement: 85, // percentage
  diseaseReductionRate: 65, // percentage
  testimonials: ["QmX...", "QmY..."], // IPFS hashes of beneficiary interviews
  verificationReports: ["QmA...", "QmB..."], // IPFS hashes of third-party verification
  imageEvidence: ["QmC...", "QmD..."] // IPFS hashes of photographic evidence
};

await impactMeasurementContract.reportImpact(
  projectId,
  milestoneId,
  impactData
);
```
